## About Penguin Jump

### Premise:

As sea levels rise, survive extreme weather by jumping from one iceberg to another for as long as you can! Donâ€™t let high winds, lightning, and hungry sharks get in your way. Collect coins to unlock all the items in your wardrobe!

### Gameplay

Penguin Jump has one game mode: an endless mode. The world is comprised of an open ocean and a path of platforms made of icebergs. When the player lands on an iceberg, the iceberg begins to slowly sink and disappear when it reaches sea level. The goal is to survive by jumping from one sinking iceberg to another and avoid falling into the ocean, where deadly sharks are waiting.

A storm mode is activated when the player's storm bar is fully charged from coin particles. During storm mode, strong winds constantly push the player left or right. Because the wind can be deadly, points collected during storm mode are doubled.

A storm cloud appears periodically and when the player moves into range, lightning strikes underneath the cloud several times. Once the lightning strikes end, the cloud disappears.

A shark will periodically roam in front of an iceberg. This shark's fin sticks up out of the water, and when the player jumps over the shark, the shark ends the player's run by jumping out of the water and pulling the player down.

Coins around the stage can be collected towards a persistent total. Watch out, though, picking up coins charges a bar that initiates storm mode which can catch the player off guard depending on the other obstacles already on the stage. This persistent coin total is used to unlock clothing items in the wardrobe accessible from the game's start menu.

### Touch Controls

The player controls the penguin character that can jump for a certain amount of time in a forward direction.

The player controls a penguin character in a game world that is comprised of an expansive ocean with a path of icebergs that are safe platforms. The goal is to get as high of a score as possible by jumping from one iceberg to another.
